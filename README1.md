# my-books

A tool for Bookies to keep track of bets and player accounts. (Hopefully more useful than a spread-sheet)

-  A user can create a 'book' which is a log of different bets, placed by different players.

-  Books, bets, and player accounts will be stored in a database

-  When a user creates a 'book', they will choose a name. The book will be displayed as a big empty card with buttons to add/modify the book.

-  When a user adds a Bet to a Book, they enter a player. they should be able to enter an ID# of an existing player or enter a name. If a name is entered, the system will create a Player by that name in the database.

   The user enters  the proposition, the Bet amount, and the juice(tax).

- A book will be displayed as a table.

- A user can quickly get a list of all their player's to see their ID's , account balances, and possible a history of all bets.

- A user can quickly view/switch between different Books.

- (STRETCH) A user can look up current lines/odds from major sites (3rd party API)

- On Game Day, the user can view bets and mark them as a Win/Loss and that player's account  will be re-calculated.         

- (SUPER STRETCH) The system will connect to a 3rd party API to automatically resolve bets.
